						<p>
							The World Wide Web is made up of HTML or <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em> documents. Approximately 30 billion documents are "webbed" by <em>hyperlinks</em>. There are three major pieces that make up the web: a user with a computer and a browser that "reads" webpages,the internet (uses HTTP to make and send requests to servers), and servers, computers optimized to host the documents that make up the web.

						HTML - Hypertext Markup Language
					</div>
					<div class="section-meat">			
						<p>
							HTML is made up of four main components: text content (what you can see), markup (creates the "look" of the page), references to other documents (e.g. images and videos), and links to other pages.
						</p>

						Markup - Tags and Elements
					</div>
					<div class="section-meat">
						<p>
							<em>Elements</em> are made up of <em>tags</em> (both opening tags, and closing tags) with content between the tags.  These tags instruct the computer to change the content between them in a particular way (e.g. making text bold or italics). 
						</p>
						<p>
							One type of tag, known as an <em>attribute</em>, can be used to create a link in the text (among other functions). For example: <a href="www.scratchpad.io">Practice HTML Here!</a>  Tags can also be used to insert images onto a page.  Keep in mind that tags create elements that are either <em>inline</em> or <em>block</em>.  Inline elements are on the line with text while block elements create an "invisible box" around the content.

						Computers are Stupid
					</div>
					<div class="section-meat">
						<p>
							Computers read instructions <em>literally</em>.  For example: if you use a bold opening tag and failed to use a closing tag, the computer would interpret that as you asking for <em>everything</em> after the opening tag to be in bold text.

						Some General Concepts to Remember
					</div>
					<div class="section-meat">
						<p>	
							1 - Webpages are text documents written in HTML and "read" by browsers.
							<br>
							<br>2 - Coding is instructions written in computer language.
							<br>
							<br>3 - Computers are stupid!
							<br>
							<br>4 - Programmers can't remember everything. Don't be afraid to look things up!
							<br>
							<br>5 - Basic HTML vocabulary: <em>tag, element, attribute</em>.

						<p>
 							Whether we are talking about the HTML code itself or the boxes that make up the "structure" of a webpage, <em>everything</em> is layered.

						Indenting: Waves and Trees
					</div>	
					<div class="section-meat">
						<p>
 							Looking at HTML code reveals a wave created by indenting the divisions (read: boxes).  You can visually see how "deep" a box is by its level of indentation.
						</p>
						<p>
							Note:  It's a good idea to create this structure first (even on paper using the "box method") before muddying the water with content.

						<p>
							We handle programming <em> just </em> like we do when designing a webpage: break the problem into pieces!

							<u>Example</u>:  Building a Search Engine
							<span class="subset-indent">
								<br>
								1 - Find Data (the bigger corpus the better)
							</span>
							<span class="subset-indent">

								2 - Build an Index

						Telling Computers What to Do
					</div>
					<div class="section-meat">
						<p>
							We uses programming "languages" to give computers instructions.  We use code languages rather than natural languages beause of computer languages are much more efficient.  Natural languages are also inherently ambiguous.
						</p>	
						<p>
							In this course, we will use <em>Python</em>.  Python is a "high level language." This means that Python runs through an interpreter (also called Python) rather than directly on the computer.
						</p>

						Language Structure: Backus-Naur Form
					</div>
					<div class="section-meat">
						<p>
							<em>Backus-Naur Form</em> is a way of discribing languages by generalizing "grammer structure."  An initial form is described and expanded with <em>non-terminals</em> until a <em>terminal</em> is reached.  
						</p>	
						<p>
							We can demonstrate this using english grammar rules.  We describe an intital form of a sentence as <em>subject-verb-object</em>.  Subjects and objects are given a non-terminal of <em>nouns</em> and those nouns are given terminal options of specific words of noun form.  
						</p>

						Variables, Strings, Indexing, Sub-Sequences, and Find
					</div>
					<div class="section-meat">
						<p>
							"Variables" are names that are assigned to expressions in the form: name = expression.  The name must start with an integer or an underscore.  The equal sign is <em>not</em> the same as equivalency in math.  Rather, in coding, the equal signs means <em>assignment</em>.
						</p>	
						<p>
							"Strings" are denoted by single or double quotes and can be letters, numbers or the "empty string."  Adding two strings together is called "concatenation."  
						</p>
						<p>
							It is possible to "index" strings, or find the value of a string at a given position.  This is achieved by printing the variable followed by brackets "[ ]" with a number (beginning at "0" for the first position).
						</p>
						<p>
							Similarly, a "sub-sequence" in a string can be identified by "[a:b]" where "a" is the starting position and "b" is the character one position before the value of "b."
						</p>
						<p>
							The position of a "search string" can be found within a "target string" by using ".find" (This will return the first occourance or -1 if the search string isn't found.  To find further occurances assign a paramter.).
						</p>
						<p>
							NOTE:  Keep in mind that 2 + 2 is NOT the same as "2" + "2"
						</p>
					</div>

				<div class="section">
					<div class="section-name">
						Functions
					</div>
					<div class="section-meat">
						<p>
							Functions have two parts: "def" and "return".  "Def" is made up of the function name followed by operands (aka inputs) followed by a colon.  The "return" portion of the function is indented below "def" and specifies what is done to create the function's output.
						</p>	
						<p>
							NOTE:  if the return is not specified then the function will return a value of "none"
						</p>
						<p>
							Once a function is definied it can be used repeatedly eliminating repetition!
						</p>

						Debugging
					</div>
					<div class="section-meat">
						<p>
							Before beginning, make sure that the problem is accurately defined. Problems are defined by a set of possible <em>inputs</em> and their relationship to desired <em>outputs</em>. 
						</p>	
						<p>
							Don't jump straight to coding and don't optimize prematuraly.  Use a systematic approach solving small parts of the larger problem one by one and synthesizing into a complete solution.

						Structured Data: Lists and For Loops
					</div>
					<div class="section-meat">
						<p>
							A string is denoted by quotes (single, double or triple) while lists are a sequence of anything (strings or another element including other lists) denoted by brackets.  You can mutate a list by reassigning one of the members of the list a different value.  Three list operations:  "Append" (adds elements to the end of a list); adding of two lists; "len" returns the number of elements in a list.

						How to Solve Problems
					</div>
					<div class="section-meat">
						<p>
							1- Understand the problem and split into different parts. 2- Define inputs and outputs. 3- Write "pseudo code". 4- Look for the simplest solution. 5- Do not optimize prematurely.
